## Project Description
**MyCode** is a simplified educational web platform built using HTML and CSS technologies to introduce HTML fundamentals to beginners aspiring to enter the world of web development. The website consists of a series of interconnected pages, including a welcoming landing page, a structured learning roadmap, and detailed lesson pages covering core concepts. The primary focus of this project is to provide clear and organized educational content with a user interface built on simplicity and clarity, ensuring that learners can grasp initial programming concepts without visual complexity or information overload.

## Project Structure & Files
1. **index.html**: The main entry point of the website. It welcomes users with the message "Welcome to the HTML Learning Site!" and features a concise description along with an illustrative image of the development process. It also includes a section for downloading supplemental material (HTML Basics) to enhance the learner's knowledge.
2. **lesson.html**: The "Roadmap" page that organizes the **three lessons** into clear, formatted cards. This allows users to visualize the learning path and provides the flexibility to choose which topic they want to start with.
3. **lesson1.html (Lesson 1)**: This lesson covers basic HTML tags and explains the fundamental difference between opening and closing tags, providing practical examples of headers and text paragraphs.
4. **lesson2.html (Lesson 2)**: Dedicated to explaining typography and types of hyperlinks. It demonstrates how to link pages internally and how to handle external links.
5. **lesson3.html (Lesson 3)**: Explains how to work with visual elements such as images and how to construct simple HTML tables to organize and display data in a professional manner.
6. **contact.html**: A simple contact page designed to open communication channels with the user, providing the developer's email address for inquiries.
7. **styles.css**: The file responsible for the visual identity of the site. It was primarily used to control the appearance of the **home page**. It imports the **Poppins** font and applies it for a modern look, while also adjusting spacing (margin/padding) and text colors to be easy on the eyes.

## Key Features
* **Responsive Design**: By utilizing Bootstrap 5, the site is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes. This allows learners to browse lessons on mobile phones or tablets with the same quality as on a desktop.
* **Clean UI**: Calm colors and gradient backgrounds were carefully selected to reduce learner distraction and maintain focus on the lesson content and code.
* **Easy Navigation**: Clear buttons are provided to return to the "Roadmap" page from any lesson, preventing users from getting lost in subpages.
* **External Resource Integration**: The site doesn't rely solely on internal explanations; it links to reputable academic sources (like Princeton University) to deepen the student's understanding.
* **Modern Typography**: The Poppins font is integrated via CSS to ensure a professional look and high readability across all modern browsers.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Used for the structural skeleton of all pages, tables, and educational text.
- **CSS3**: Used for visual customization, font selection, color schemes, and enabling smooth scrolling.
- **Bootstrap 5**: Utilized for page organization and ensuring consistent element distribution through the Grid System and pre-defined classes.
- **Google Fonts**: Integrated to provide a modern aesthetic for the interface text.
- **AI Tools**: Leveraged as a powerful assistant for code review, debugging, and selecting visually harmonious color gradients.

## How I Learned from CS50 & Built the Project
Through my journey in **CS50**, I learned the vital importance of code organization and building web applications that adhere to proper programming standards. I applied these concepts in my project by linking pages logically and using an **external CSS file** to maintain a consistent global style. I faced real technical challenges, particularly in handling **Bootstrap framework classes** and ensuring every element was placed correctly to maintain layout symmetry. Additionally, **formatting navigation buttons (links)** to ensure smooth movement between the roadmap and the three lessons without broken paths was a significant learning experience. With the help of educational resources and AI tools, I was able to overcome these hurdles and reach the final result successfully.

## Future Improvements
In future iterations of this project, I plan to evolve the platform into a comprehensive reference by:
1. Increasing the number of lessons to include more advanced HTML topics.
2. Adding a **Quizzes** feature at the end of each lesson to measure student comprehension.
3. Implementing **Progress Tracking** so learners can see which lessons they have completed.
4. Expanding the curriculum to include other programming languages and technologies like CSS and JavaScript for a complete full-stack learning experience.

## How to Run
1. Place all HTML files and the `styles.css` file in a single directory.
2. Open `index.html` using any modern web browser.
3. Use the provided links and buttons to navigate between the roadmap and the lessons.
